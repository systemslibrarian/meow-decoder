    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa 0.9.10 - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
    # Status: No fixed upgrade available
    # Mitigation: Comes from yubikey dependency which we use only for ECDH key derivation,
    # not for RSA operations. The vulnerable RSA code path is not exercised.
    # Risk: LOW - Not using RSA encryption/decryption
    "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",
    
    # RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste 1.0.15 - unmaintained crate
    # Status: Transitive dependency from cryptoki
    # Mitigation: paste is a compile-time macro crate with no runtime security implications.
    # Risk: LOW - Compile-time only, no runtime attack surface
