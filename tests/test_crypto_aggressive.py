🐱 DEPRECATED - Tests consolidated into test_crypto.py

This file previously contained aggressive coverage tests for crypto.py.
All unique tests have been merged into the canonical test_crypto.py file.

DO NOT ADD NEW TESTS HERE - use test_crypto.py instead.

Kept as stub for backward compatibility and to prevent accidental recreation.
